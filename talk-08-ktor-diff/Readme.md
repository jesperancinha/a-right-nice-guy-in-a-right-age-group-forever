# Ktor diff to Spring

## Quick Intro

Ktor looks on the outside to be a framework like many others that we have learned to work with such as Micronaut and
Spring framework. Ktor offers a multitude of possibilities in designing and implementing web services and provides
various possibilities including reactive and native services. In this session, I want to demo a few examples of how we
can implement Ktor using the different layers of the onion design pattern (data, services, controller). Also, I will
attempt to answer a few questions: Do we need to implement REST services this way? Do we have to follow the onion design
pattern? How exactly Ktor makes a difference?
