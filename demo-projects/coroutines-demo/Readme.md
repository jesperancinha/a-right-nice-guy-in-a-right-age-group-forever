# coroutines-demo

## Introduction

This is a coroutines test count demo

## Info

The usage of `Thread.sleep` in this example is to illustrate how dispatchers make use of threads.
It is used <ins>only</ins> for demonstration purposes.

It is not recommended and it is considered to be an anti-pattern to use `Thread.sleep` because this will block the `Thread`. Use `delay` instead. It will schedule the coroutine to continue later on.
