# Kong Kotlin Application Configs

## Quick Intro

Kotlin allows us to create beautiful, easy-to-read, and generic code in different ways. In this session, we will have a
look at the different ways Kong can provide extra features to our Kotlin applications. We will have a look at quick
examples of how these features can be implemented in the back-end via Kotlin and how some of these features can work
together with Kong. The highlights are how can we access our application via OAuth2 with a pure Kotlin implementation or
via Kong, apply rate-limiting, and use StatsD, CORS, and metric analytics with Prometheus and Moesif API. This session
intends especially to show how can we, with services implemented with Spring and/or Micronaut and Kotlin, can get an
optimal workflow between our applications, Kong, and the outside world. Further, we will also see, with examples, how
can we get this configured in real-time with an angular administration application, speaking to our own Kotlin
implemented back-end service in Spring. For example, we will see how can we limit traffic to an application and
visualize that with Locust in real-time, and observe how traffic easily gets limited at a push of a button with our own
custom application.
