# Kotlin Native Now

## Quick Intro

Kotlin native promises us a way to use Kotlin as the source code and compile it to executables that our operating system
understands. The great thing about it is that most of the work related to native is done for us via Kotlin Native.
However, Kotlin Native is something still in the making but already has advantages that can be used in a production
environment. In this session want to demonstrate how interoperability works, how can we use C code (if we really have
to) and get is to be interpreted in our Kotlin code and of course how can we compile and monitor running Kotlin native
applications. In the end we will have a discussion with the audience to raise awareness of Kotlin Native and to
understand where it can be used.
