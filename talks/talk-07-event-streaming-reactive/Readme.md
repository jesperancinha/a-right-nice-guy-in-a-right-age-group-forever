# Event Streaming Reactive

## Quick Intro

Event streaming is not a new concept. Coroutines are also not a new concept. However, these two concepts, together, are
only now being widely used and considered for new developments and updates of old applications. Kotlin provides a way to
implement applications in a reactive way using coroutines and implementing event streams. We will have a look at
different running application examples and how they can respond to event triggers, how they can digest event messages
and how that plays out in terms of performance. We will also draw a few comparisons to understand how reactive
architecture works. We'll talk about channels, sinks, streaming, consumers, and much more.
