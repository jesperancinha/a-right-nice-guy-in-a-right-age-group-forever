# Kong Unirest Lightning

# Quick Intro

Developing a REST client can be very easy but in some cases, it can be a very daunting experience. In this session, I
will bring in a complex REST application service and a Kong gateway portal and we'll experience together and live how
the development of a client can be done quite fast with increasing complexity with the Java Unirest Library. The code
will be developed in Kotlin for the client whereas the service will be already available running in the background.
