# Distributed Cache System with Kotlin

## Quick Intro

Working with a distributed cache system provides leverage to make applications faster by avoiding too many database
operations. Not only that, but a cache system can also play a crucial role in avoiding unnecessary repeated
calculations. In this session, we're going to go to the insides and outs of data processing in Kotlin with generics,
flow, data streams, and a couple of surprises, to get systems optimal. We're going to have a look at a fictional banking
system and have a look at different situations where crucial decisions can be made to allow our Bank to be efficient and
still remain reliable in reaching an optimal SLA. This session combines a thorough review of data processing in Kotlin
and how can we apply it considering a distributed cache system like Hazelcast. We'll have a look at data grids and how
can we populate them efficiently using Kotlin as the backbone of our services.
